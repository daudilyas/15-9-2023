Today, I tried to contact those people who have applied for the job and bring them onto WhatsApp in the first hour. In the second hour, I attempted to contact them and asked for their availability. In the other two hours, if they agree, I will schedule interviews with them. However, no one has applied for the job yet, so I received a new task, which is to teach my coworker about the application career sheet, where we input candidate details about the interview.
